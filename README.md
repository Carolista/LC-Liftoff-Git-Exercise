# LC-Liftoff-Git-Exercise
For students to practice Git/Github basics

## GET STARTED

### A. Fork this repo to your own account!
Now you've got your own copy to work with and you'll have permissions to do whatever you want with it.

### B. Clone it to your local machine.
Make *absolutely sure* you do not put it in a directory that already contains a git repo. (When in doubt, enable viewing hidden files and look for a `.git` file in that directory or a parent directory.) Use `git clone <paste link here>` to put a copy of the project on your hard drive.

### C. Open the project in VS Code.
For now, you'll just have a `README.md` file. (Which is the very file you are currently reading!)

## MAKE LOCAL CHANGES & PUSH TO GITHUB

### A. Make an edit to this README below between the line breaks.
Just write a simple sentence that describes how your capstone project will show off your skills to a potential employer, or what you hope your users will like the most about your app, or something like that. (This repo has nothing to do with your project but it's a good thing to think about at this stage of Liftoff!)

### B. Save, commit, and push changes to Github.

## USE A FEATURE BRANCH & PUSH TO GITHUB
You very rarely will have a good reason to commit something directly to `main`. You always want to use **feature branches** to make changes, then when a branch has code that works and you're done with that part for now, you merge it to `main` and stop using that feature branch. 
> IMPORTANT: The `main` branch should *always* be working and not broken. But your feature branches can be broken as much as they need to be while you're coding, which is appropriate during development!

### A. Create a new branch.
1. In the command line (making sure you're inside the repository folder), enter `git checkout -b my-first-branch`.


## UPDATE MAIN ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE BEFORE CREATING ANOTHER NEW FEATURE BRANCH

## MAKE CHANGES DIRECTLY ON GITHUB & PULL TO LOCAL MACHINE
